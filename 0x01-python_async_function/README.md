## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
1. async and await syntax
2. How to execute an async program with asyncio
3. How to run concurrent coroutines
4. How to create asyncio tasks
5. How to use the random module

## Requirements
# General
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
5. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
6. Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
7. The length of your files will be tested using wc
8. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
9. All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
10. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
11. All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
